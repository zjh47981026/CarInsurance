                    Auto liability coverage pays for damage you cause to others — including physical injuries to people and property damage —
                    and it's required in nearly every state. At Progressive, liability
                    coverage is included in nearly every car insurance policy and can be
                    customized to your needs. Every state sets its own minimum limit requirements for BI and PD, and your Progressive auto policy will always meet your state's minimum coverage requirements.
                    You can also choose to increase your liability coverage limits.

                    If you're hit by a driver who's found at fault and has no insurance or
                    insufficient coverage, uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage
                    can pay for medical treatment for you and your passengers, as well as the
                    damage to your vehicle. Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage is divided
                    into two parts — bodily injury (UMBI) for medical expenses and property damage (UMPD)
                    for physical damage to your vehicle and property.

                    Personal injury protection, or PIP, can
                    cover medical bills for you and your passengers
                    from injuries sustained in a car accident, regardless
                    of who's at fault. Depending on the state you live in,
                    it can also provide coverage for lost wages, household
                    services, and other expenses related to your injuries.
                    PIP coverage is required in certain states and is offered
                    as an optional coverage in a handful of other states.

                    requirements to see if PIP could apply to your policy.

                    Collision coverage helps pay to repair or replace your
                    vehicle after an accident, regardless of who's at fault.
                    It also applies if you hit an object, other than an animal,
                    such as a tree or utility pole. Collision coverage is optional,
                    but many leasing companies and lenders require it as part of their
                    loan/lease agreement. When you add collision coverage to your auto
                    policy, you'll choose a deductible amount, which is the amount
                    you'll pay out of pocket
                    to repair or replace your car when you file a collision claim.
