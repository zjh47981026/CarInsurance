         <p>You can easily file a claim by logging in to your policy online, through the mobile app, or by calling our
             claims center.  We just need
             some basic info from you to get started.
             We connect you with the right experts at the right time to make sure everything goes smoothly. You can
             contact a claims rep if you have questions, and you’ll likely work with an estimator who will inspect your
             car and write an estimate describing the cost of repairs.

            <h4>02 / <b>Inspection and repair options</b></h4>
            <p>
                A rep asks if you want to get your repairs completed or receive payment. The choice is yours! If you’re
                not sure, you can get an estimate first to see how much repairs cost or what your payment is for the
                repairs. If you finance or lease your car, your lender may require you to get the repairs.

                If you're getting repairs, you can choose one of our convenient network shop locations. Or your rep can
                schedule time for an estimator to inspect your vehicle (if they haven't done so already) at your shop
                of choice, or at our drive-in location (where available).

            <p>
                Your rep schedules repairs through a network repair shop or any other shop you’d like. We help you
                through the process to make sure all repairs are being handled properly.

                No matter which shop you choose, we manage the repairs from start to finish. Then, when everything is
                complete, just pick up your newly repaired car and go. If you used a shop in our approved network, your
                repairs are guaranteed for as long as you own or lease your vehicle.
